- The date and time of your submission is taken from the Blackboard server and is recorded when your submission is complete, not when you click Submit.

- It is essential that you check that you have submitted the correct file(s), and that each complete file was received. Submission receipts are accessed from the Coursework tab.

There is no late submission permitted on this timed assessment. Ensure that you submit your submission in good time. Neither the module leader nor module team can accept late assessments, do not ask them to do so.



# Background to the research

The head of school for a four year degree course has provided you with some data based on student demographics, marks and graduate outcomes. 

They have asked you if the data could reveal findings that may be relevant for monitoring student performance and outcomes.


# Data instructions

Your individual data set is accessed via Blackboard >>> Assessments >>> Dewis Data For Exam.

You must only analyse the specified data. No other data is to be used for this assessment.

All data manipulation and analyses must be done within R.

# Data structure

The variables collected for each student are:

studentID – a unique student identifier issued to each student at the start of the course

outcome – employment status one year after finishing the course (E1 = employed in a graduate role, E2 =Employed in a non-graduate role, Education = in full time further education, Unemployed = not yet employed)

age – age at start of course

gender – gender at start of course

language – score given for student level of English proficiency determined as part of the application process for the course (minimum 0, maximum 10)

feedback – score given by student for their satisfaction of the course when asked at the end of Year 4 (minimum 0, maximum 10)

Mark1 - Mark for Year 1 (out of 100)

Mark2 - Mark for Year 2 (out of 100)

Mark3 - Mark for Year 3 (out of 100)

Mark4 – Mark for Year 4 (out of 100)

### Answer:
```{r data}
# load the dataset here
ds <- read.csv("/Users/sambaggott/Desktop/contents-2.csv")
```

```{r Q1 }
# further data preparation here
ds
summary(ds) #Initial summary of the data
str(ds) #Checked the data structure

ds
boxplot(ds$age) #Created a boxplot of age and detected an outlier

filtered_ds = subset (ds, age < 70) #Removed row with year of birth instead of age

sum(is.na(filtered_ds2)) #Checked for number of missing values

filtered_ds2 <- na.omit(filtered_ds) #Removed rows with missing values

sum(is.na(filtered_ds2)) #Checked missing values have been removed

summary(filtered_ds2)#Summary of clean data

new_col_names <- c("StudentID", "Gender", "Age", "Outcome", "Language", "Feedback", "Mark1", "Mark2", "Mark3", "Mark4")
colnames(filtered_ds2) <- new_col_names #Capitalized column names and renamed Year to Mark to improve formatting

CleanDs <- filtered_ds2

```


# Question 2 

A colleague suggests the following research question,

 “do students perform differently in their final year relative to their performance at the start?”

To assess this research question:

- create a new variable for the difference between Year 4 mark and Year 1 Mark.

- show and interpret a confidence interval for the mean difference, in context of the research question.

**(12 marks)**

### Answer: 
I began by creating data frame and inputting the new variable created for the difference between year 4 and year 1 marks. From this, I then created a histogram to depict the distribution of this variable. Finally, I ran a linear regression model which revealed a 95% confidence interval for the true mean mark improvement. In other words, I can be 95% sure that the true mean mark difference for this group of students is within the range of 8.52 to 9.23.
```{r Q2}
CleanDs
#Creates a new variable
CleanDs
MarkDiff <- CleanDs$Mark4 - CleanDs$Mark1

#Creates linear model

model1 <- lm(MarkDiff ~ 1, data = MarkDiff)

confint(model1, level = 0.95)

#Creates histogram
hist(MarkDiff,
     breaks = seq(min(MarkDiff), max(MarkDiff) + 5, by = 5),
     col = "grey", border = "black",
     main = "Student Mark Improvement Distribution",
     xlab = "Mark Improvement (Year 4 Mark - Year 1 Mark)",
     ylab = "Student Count")

```



# Question 3

Another research question is suggested, 

“is there a relationship between student marks across each of the years?”

- Assess this research question by showing and interpreting the linear correlations between the marks for each of the four years.

Marks are awarded for well-designed output, and the interpretation of the output.

**(12 marks)**

### Answer:
The correlation coefficients indicate a moderate positive correlation (0.52) between marks 1 and 2. A moderate positive correlation (0.53) between Mark1 and Mark3. These first two correlations are the strongest which suggests that there is a more consistent relationship between these two marks, compared to the other marks. 

A weak positive correlation was found between mark 1 and mark 4 (0.23) as well as between mark 2 and mark 3 (0.22). A moderate positive correlation (0.32) between mark 2 and mark 4. A weak positive correlation (0.15) between mark3 and mark4. This correlation is the weakest, which suggests that the relationship between marks 3 and 4 is less consistent.

  align = c("l", "c"),  # Aligns columns
  caption = "Correlation Coefficients Between Variable Pairs",  # Adds a caption
  col.names = c("Mark Pair", "Correlation Coefficient"),#Renames column headers
)
```


# Question 4

A further research question states, 

“can the final year mark be predicted based on one mark for a previous year?”

Produce simple linear regression with Year 4 mark as the dependent variable, and only one independent variable.

Your answer should include:

- justification for the choice of explanatory variable, including any additional supporting exploratory data analyses used to make the choice;

- interpretation of the slope (gradient) coefficient;

- comment on the r-square value, and the validity of model assumptions.


**(23 marks)**

### Answer:
I decided to use mark 2 as my explanatory variable as it has the biggest correlation with mark 4. The coefficient for mark 2 is 0.32 which means for every one mark that mark 2 increases mark 4 increases by 0.32, on average. The standard error of 0.07 is relatively small, which indicates that the estimate of the coefficient is likely to be close to the true population value. The P value (0.41e-05) is extremely small, and as it is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, which means that the coefficient for mark 2 is statistically significant. 
```{r Q4}
CleanDs
plot(x = CleanDs$Mark2,
     y = CleanDs$Mark4,
     xlab = "Mark 2",
     ylab = "Mark 4",
     pch = 9,
     main = "Correlation Between Mark 2 and Mark 4")

# Linear regression model
model1 <- lm(Mark4 ~ Mark2, data = CleanDs)

# Adds a linear regression line
abline(model1, col = "blue")

# Adds lablels
legend("topleft", legend = "Mark 2", pch = 9, col = "black")
legend("topright", legend = "Mark 4", pch = 9, col = "black")

model1 <- lm(Mark4 ~ Mark2, data = CleanDs)

summary(model1)
```




# Question 5:  Report


Clearly state one **alternative new** research question based on the full original data set supplied to you. Explain why this is a worthwhile research question to consider.

You are required to write a short report for the client showing some analyses based only on the research question you have selected. 

In your report you may wish to include a number of the following: exploratory data analyses; a hypothesis test; data modelling; discussion of limitations; how you could extend the research if given more time.

To clarify, your answer to this question must be a report based on **your analyses of your own research question** arising from the data, which is not addressed in the questions above. This report should contain a maximum 5 outputs (i.e. graphics + tables) and a maximum of 500 words.


**(35 marks)**

### Answer:
Hypothesis:

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in mean mark 4 scores between students with high and low English language literacy scores.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Students with higher English language literacy scores have significantly higher mean mark 4 scores compared to students with lower English language literacy scores.

This research is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, if there is a significant relationship, then changes could be made to make the course resources more accessible for those who aren't as literate in English. Further to this, the results may help advise the teachers to make sure they are speaking clearly and not too quickly to aim to minimize the impact of poorer English skills. The importance of having lectures recorded could be highlighted, to allow people the opportunity to go through the content at their own pace. For students, if English literacy is a predictor of success on the course then it is important this is highlighted to them as it may motivate them to improve their English language skills. Support sessions could be implemented to help students who wish to work on this. 

I began by running so summary statistics on the language variable. I needed to create a new variable that categorized students into two groups based on their English language literacy scores. Both the median and the mean were 5 so I decided to class students with a score of 5 or above as having 'high' levels of English language skills, and those with 4 or below as having 'low'. Next, I conducted a two sample t-test to compare the means of mark 4 between the two groups. The p value is 0.48 which is much greater than 0.05, which indicates there is not enough evidence to conclude that English language skills significantly impact mark 4, therefore I failed to reject the null hypothesis. However, this was a relatively small sample size and therefore there is not enough evidence to conclude for certain that English language skills don't affect students final mark.
```{r Q5}
CleanDs
summary(CleanDs$Language)

# Set the cutoff point for high and low proficiency
cutoff_point <- 5

# Created the new variable EnglishLanguageLiteracyGroup
CleanDs$LanguageGroup <- ifelse(CleanDs$Language >= cutoff_point, "High", "Low")

# Display the first few rows of the updated data frame
head(CleanDs)

CleanDs
t_test_result <- t.test(Mark4 ~ LanguageGroup, data = CleanDs)
print(t_test_result)

#Creates a box plot
boxplot(Mark4 ~ LanguageGroup, data = CleanDs, col = c("lightblue", "darkgreen"), 
        main = "Boxplot of Final Marks by Literacy Group", 
        xlab = "Literacy Group",
        ylab = "Final Marks")    

#Creates a new variable "bar_data"
CleanDs
bar_data <- aggregate(Mark4 ~ LanguageGroup, data = CleanDs, mean)

# Create the bar chart
barplot(bar_data$Mark4, names.arg = bar_data$LanguageGroup, col = c("lightblue", "darkgreen"),
        main = "Mean Final Marks by Literacy Group", ylab = "Mean Final Marks")
```
